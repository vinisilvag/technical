All these codes were developed in the 2017-2019 period. At that time, I was using Windows as my main operating system and, therefore, many of the codes only work for that OS, since, in an attempt to make the terminal experience more pleasant for any user, I "abused" customizations to the throughout program (change colors during execution, change the size of the terminal window, etc).

Unfortunately, this means that most of these codes cannot be executed by any user in any SO :((

> I intend, in the future, to edit them to make this possible. However, until then, they will remain here only as a record of my development over that time.
